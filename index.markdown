        A faithful daughter of God, a loving wife, a cat mom, an enthusiast of whole foods diet and glucose revolution, an amateur painter/doodler, a data-driven product software engineer with 8+ years of industry experience - from FAANG companies handling billions of user data to seed-round startups building everything from the ground up. Whatever I do, I love what I put my hands on.
